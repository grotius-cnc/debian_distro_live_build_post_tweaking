In this document we dive into rebranding a Linux Distro in a more special way.
Normally we modify the files trough the terminal. 

But if we want to check gui colors, background colors, etc. We need a desktop visualisation.

The steps :

1. Download iso, copy the iso on usb, copy the files to pc include hidden file, unsquash. ( see previous documents )
2. Log into the "squasfs-root" dir with chroot and start up a chroot desktop environment.
